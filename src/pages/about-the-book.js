									 	Rachel’s story is a true one of young love, joys, and triumphs experienced,

										Her story begins in her early teens while growing up in Southern Kentucky and being 
										the oldest child in a large family of very strict parents. She relates of the rigors
										involved during post–Great Depression years, through WWII, and in her high school years.
										As a senior in high school with a diploma, a certainty along with a lucrative scholarship 
										promised, she begins to see that her dreams of becoming a teacher can really happen.
