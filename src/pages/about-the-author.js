                                        Rachel G Carrington was born in a small southern Kentucky town in 1930. 
                                        She was first-born of eleven children to loving, but strict, low-income parents
                                        who struggled to keep food on the table and could afford little more than that. 
                                        Attending school and earning a high school diploma was a given but, lack of funds
                                        made further education impossible.

                                    <p>
                                        Rachel's desire to learn made it easy to comply with her parent's demands 
                                        of school attendance and, as a result, she was offered a prestigious scholarship 
                                        during her senior year of high school. A common wad of paper changed things 
                                        drastically, causing her to abruptly choose another path.

                                    <p>
                                        Though void of higher education, fantastic employment or honors earned, 
                                        Rachel's multifaceted life was filled with a special kind of joy in her 
                                        sixty-two years of marriage. Follow her journey as she travels this 
                                        path through hardships and successes, filled with love as she and her 
                                        chosen mate successfully bring two families together and work toward 
                                        success in making life easier for all concerned. Through it all, the Carringtons 
                                        trust in the heavenly Father to see them through.

                                        Rachel now makes her home in Ocala Florida. Besides her early life in Kentucky,
                                        she has previously resided in Butler County Ohio and Honolulu (Waikiki) Hawaii.
                                        She continues to write and hopes to have a sequel to The Early Years in the 
                                        near future.
